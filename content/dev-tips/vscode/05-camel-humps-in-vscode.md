While development, to navigate through the code you might often use <i>alt + arrow keys</i> to move the cursor by word.

<br/>

But while working with camelcasing, it does not consider the words within the camelcase. To move the cursor with respect to the camelcased words, we can use an extension in VSCode called <a href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maptz.camelcasenavigation' target='_blank'>Camel Case Navigation</a>

<br/>

It allows us to move the cursor with respect to camelcased words. Here's how it works:
