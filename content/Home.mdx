Hey there! I'm **Akul Srivastava** â€” a self-taught software engineer currently building things out of the city of nawabs - Lucknow, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ (remotely, of course â€” coffee in one hand, keyboard in the other). I drop by my workplace in Bangalore also, few times a year â€” you know, to prove I'm not just a Slack profile photo.

<div class="spacer" />

I did my engineering in computer science from <abbr title="Babu Banarasi Das: National Institute of Technology and Management">BBD-NITM</abbr>, but my real education
came from endless hours of debugging and building things that occasionally even worked
on the first try. I'm currently working as a <Link href='/work#current'>software engineer</Link> at <a href="https://smallcase.com" target="_blank">smallcase</a>, and before this,
I helped keep things rolling at <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/companies/vogo/__D5_Gnrubf6xPYpkAylDV5MfJEQs3yeaFX0mKz46EMGo" target="_blank">Vogo</a>. Interested in the stuff Iâ€™ve actually shipped and not just talked about? you can head over to my <Link href="/work">work</Link> page.

I specialize in crafting sleek web and mobile applications â€” think of it as digital carpentry, minus the mess. Over the years, Iâ€™ve built more websites than I care to count, and the internet has the receipts.

<div class="spacer" />

When Iâ€™m not shipping code or squashing bugs, I like to share <Link href="/dev-tips">development tips</Link>, write <Link href="/blogs">blogs</Link> about all things tech, software engineering and occasionally get philosophical. Iâ€™m also a fan of <Link href="/opensource">opensource</Link> â€” youâ€™ll find traces of me lurking in GitHub repos across the web.
