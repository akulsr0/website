While work, we often have the need to transfer files between different device on same network.

<br />

Here's a way to do that:

- Open [sharedrop.io](https://sharedrop.io)
- Create a room by clicking _plus icon_ on the top right corner.<br/>

- Scan the QR or open the given link on your second device.<br/>

- Click on the icon of device where you want to send file, choose the file(s) you want to send.<br />

- Send and accept the file from both device respectively.<br/>

That's how you can easily transfer file(s) between two different devices on same network.
