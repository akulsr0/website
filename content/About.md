Hey there, I am Akul, self trained software developer. I have done bachelors in Computer Science Engineering from Babu Banarasi Das: National Institute of Technology and Management, Lucknow. I am currently working at <a href='https://vogo.in/' target='_blank'>Vogo</a> as Software Engineer (Frontend).

<br />

I have experience in Javascript/Typescript ecosystem, and primarily work on the same. In frontend, I prefer React and Next.js where as in backend I have worked with Node/Express and MongoDB.

<br />

I have also put my hands in Mobile App Development, starting with Native Android Development (Android Studio), and eventually shifting to React Native for cross platform development. I have also published some of my apps on the Google Play, you can check them <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Akul+Srivastava' target='_blank'>here</a>.

<br />

I also like to explore opensource projects and contribute to them. Recently, I created <a href='https://github.com/sanesource' target='_blank'>sanesource</a> where I will be sharing my opensource work from now on.
