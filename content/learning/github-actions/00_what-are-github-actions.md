## what are github actions?

Github Action is a platform through which we can automate our software development workflows. You can create actions which needs to run on certain events.

**For example:** running linting checks when a pull request is raised

In the above example, our action is _running linting check_, and event is _when a pull request is raised_.

Github Action is a platform which helps us in continuous integration, delivery and testing. It lets us automate our builds, tests, deployments and other checks like (linting, formatting) etc... Even, with its help we can manage our repository by automating adding labels, adding target impact area, adding comments, assigning to particular codeowner, closing stale issues and pull request and much more.
If we want to create a robust development workflow, we can do it with the help of Github Actions.
