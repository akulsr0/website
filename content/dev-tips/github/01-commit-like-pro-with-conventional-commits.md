While building software(s), a crucial part is to maintain the versions of it. Github/Git is most popular and widely used for the same.
In this process, committing code is a common part. These commits carry a message with them for identification. It's good to follow a structured way of commiting, so that it looks neat and in future if we want to automate something out of it, it could turn helpful.

### Conventional Commits

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.

To follow these conventions, there is a nice extension available in VSCode, which we can use to commit our code.
