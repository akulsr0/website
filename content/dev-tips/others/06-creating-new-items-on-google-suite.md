As a developer, in our day to day life, we often need to create mutiple google docs, sheets, slides, meetings, notes and what not.

There's a way of instantly creating new gsuite items, which we can use to boost our productivity.

We can just use \<service\>.new to create new items

<br>

**For example:**

- To create a new document: <a href='https://docs.new' target='_blank'>docs.new</a>
- To create a new sheet: <a href='https://sheets.new' target='_blank'>sheets.new</a>
- To create a new slide: <a href='https://slides.new' target='_blank'>slides.new</a>
- To create a new form: <a href='https://forms.new' target='_blank'>forms.new</a>
- To create a new meeting: <a href='https://meet.new' target='_blank'>meet.new</a>
- To create a new note: <a href='https://keep.new' target='_blank'>keep.new</a>

<br>

**Pro Tip:**
This works with Github as well. <br>
If you want to create a new repository, you can simply goto <a href='https://github.new' target='_blank'>github.new</a>
