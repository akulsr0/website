Here is a tool called [Pelican](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1524721688), which allows us to manage our clipboard history more efficiently.

<br />

Suppose we have a long form to fill, and we already have the data, we just need to paste it there. The general approach would be to copy and paste one field at a time.

But with Pelican, we can copy all the fields in one go and then paste it as per our requirements.

<br />

**Steps**

- Install Pelican from App Store ([here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1524721688))
- Copy all the information/fields
