You might have been in the place where you have a lot of tabs opened in your browser, including the one's which you are not using that frequently but they are still eating up your device memory and energy. With Chrome 110, there are two modes - <a href='https://blog.google/products/chrome/new-chrome-features-to-save-battery-and-make-browsing-smoother/' target='_blank'>memory saver and energy saver</a> which we can use to optimize our system's performance.

<br />

### Enabling memory and energy saver on chrome

- <a href='https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=1' target='_blank'>Update your chrome</a> to v110 or above
- Open **Settings** > **Performance** then turn on **memory/energy saver**.

<br />

Now with the above modes enabled, chrome will save up memory and energy from the inactive tabs.
